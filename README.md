Dear Kristine,

I just wanted to share something from my heart. 
You're so pretty, and your personality is amazing! 
I really admire you for so many things, like your love for playing chess 
and your incredible talent as an amazing journalist.

Someday, I hope we can meet and maybe play a game of chess together. 
For now, Iâ€™m not ready to reveal my identity, but I want you to know 
that you have a secret admirer who thinks you're absolutely wonderful.

With admiration,
A Secret Admirer
