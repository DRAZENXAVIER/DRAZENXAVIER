    Dear {name},

    I just wanted to share something from my heart. 
    You're so pretty, and your personality is amazing! 
    I really admire you for so many things, like your love for {hobbies[0]} 
    and your incredible talent as {hobbies[1]}.

    Someday, I hope we can meet and maybe play a game of chess together. 
    For now, Iâ€™m not ready to reveal my identity, but I want you to know

    With admiration,
